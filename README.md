# dockerized-basic-dev-and-prod-react
A basic dockerized react app with a prod docker file plus a dev one.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Docker

With docker and docker-compose installed, you can run it all inside docker 
### `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .`
outputs a hash ... use it (or the first 10 or so chars of it) for running the docker image, as in...
### `docker run -it 335074bf`
or run an alternative command such as the tess inside the container.
### `docker run -it 335074bf npm run test`

Production docker build...

### `docker build .`
uses the Dockerfile to npm build, and to create the docker file for production level use.

# Docker-compose
Use docker-compose to simplify starting up the docker file, since it can specify the volumes for development-mode copying, plus the port.  Note the use of two mappings in the docker-compose.yml file, so that the node_modules are ignored but everything else is copied.  We want that because we want to build the node_modules *inside* the app, and not to copy them from outside.  The current setup should allow reloading of a page after editing relevant files, as the files will be seen to have changed.

### `docker-compose up`  
or 
### `docker-compose up --build`
 to start up the services
